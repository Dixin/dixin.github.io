[Courier New](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_New#Courier_New) is an excellent [monospaced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font) (non-proportional) [typeface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface) introduced with [Windows 3.1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1). As a UI designer, I cannot tell how many year I have worked with Courier New. As the release of Visual Studio 2010 and the new MSDN, [Consolas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas) becomes the default font of code.

The latest code font definition of MSDN is:

```csharp
font-family: Consolas, Courier, monospace;
font-size: 0.83em;
```

[According to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas):

> Consolas is a monospaced (non-proportional) typeface, designed by [Lucas de Groot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_de_Groot). It is a part of a new suite of fonts that take advantage of Microsoft's [ClearType](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearType) font rendering technology.

Although it is introduced with [Windows Vista](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_vista) and [Office 2007](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_2007), Consolas first came into my eyes later along with dev10. After playing with it for over 2 years, I think it is time to say goodbye to Courier New and catch up with the UI design of Visual Studio and MSDN.

For me, Courier New is as beautiful as Consolas; Consolas rocks mainly because of [ClearType](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearType).
