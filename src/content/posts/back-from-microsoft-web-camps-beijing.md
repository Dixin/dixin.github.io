I am just back from [Microsoft Web Camps](http://www.webcamps.ms/), where Web developers in Beijing had a good time for 2 days with 2 fantastic speakers, [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) and [James Senior](http://www.jamessenior.com/).

On day 1, Scott and James talked about Web Platform Installer, ASP.NET core runtime, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, Visual Studio 2010, … They were humorous and smart, and everyone was excited!

On day 2, developers were organized into teams to build Web applications. At the end of day 2, each team had a chance of presentation. Before ending, I also demonstrated my so-called “[WebOS](http://www.coolwebos.com/)”, a tiny but funny Web website [developed with ASP.NET MVC and jQuery](/posts/introducing-coolwebos-com), which looks like an operating system, to show the power of ASP.NET MVC and jQuery. Scott, James and me were joking there, and people cannot help laughing and applauding…

You can play with it here: [http://www.coolwebos.com/](http://www.coolwebos.com/), if interested.

I discussed with Scott and James about Web and ASP.NET, like some [junior ideas](/posts/anti-forgery-request-recipes-for-asp-net-mvc-and-ajax) on ASP.NET MVC anti-forgery request, etc. I also helped on some English / Chinese translation. At the end Scott gave me a fabulous gift, which I will post to blog later.

Hope Microsoft can have more and more events like this!
