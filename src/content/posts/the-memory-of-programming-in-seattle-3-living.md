## Homestead: The Hotel

When first arriving in the US, I lived in this hotel [Homestead in Bellevue](http://www.homesteadhotels.com/hotels/seattle-bellevue.html) for several days:

It is very close to Building 27 of Microsoft.

These two pictures are [from the Internet](http://www.undercovertourist.com/united-states/washington/seattle/hotels/homestead-seattle-redmond.html):

I remember it took me a very long time to check in.

## Central Park East: The apartment

After days I moved to [Central Park East](http://www.centralparkeastapartments.net/), where I had a [living of peace and relaxation](http://www.centralparkeastapartments.net/TourApartments.aspx) for over half a year. It was comfortable, and there are swimming pool and gym. Again, the following are shot by my [legacy Nokia N73](http://www.nokiausa.com/find-products/phones/nokia-n73):

These are the heavy snow in the winter of 2008:

This was outside my window:

Inside my apartment, these are shot by my roommate Steven:
