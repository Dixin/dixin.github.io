10 [LINQ via C#](/posts/linq-via-csharp) events have been held successfully. Each event is a pure English speaking technical talk. I designed some posters for the events, with no enough time to design for each event.

## LINQ via C# part 4

In part 3, lambda expression of C# is introduced, in which audiences are very interested. So according to the feedback, in part 4 [lambda calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) is introduced in detail. On the poster there are a big lambda symbol and the classic lambda expression - [Y combinator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_combinator#Y_combinator).

## LINQ via C# part 5

In part 4 people are attracted by lambda calculus. So in part 5 it is extended, and a little functional C# is introduced as well.

This is based on a photo. The flower was shot in [Chengdu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu) by my brother. On this poster, just the seeds are changed into a λ symbol, which also looks like a Y.

## LINQ via C# part 7

This is copycat. I was very busy during that time, so I just picked up a wallpaper for Windows 7 in my computer, and changed the logo and text into LINQ stuff.

## LINQ via C# part 9 and part 10

I believe this one should be fancy enough, though it is nothing.

All posters are designed by [Fireworks](http://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks/). It is much lighter than Photoshop.
