This is a true story. This morning I went to office by train of Beijing subway, and 4 developers were sitting next to me and talking about Web development and their Web product. After a while, someone asked an interesting question: What is the protocol of AJAX?

Dev A said, “Its protocol is XML.”

Dev B argued, “No. The protocol should be Silverlight.”

Dev C was confused, “As I remember, it should be something sounds like HttpSilverlight.”

D spoke like a dev lead, “No you all didn’t get the point. AJAX itself is a kind of protocol. So, the protocol of AJAX is just AJAX.”

So finally, they made the agreement.
