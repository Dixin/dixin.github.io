There are many choices for food in Seattle.

## Sichuanese food

Around the apartment (introduced in [part 3](/posts/the-memory-of-programming-in-seattle-3-living)), there are at least 3 Sichuanese restaurants.

Mark and Wei took me an Steven to this place, where I had my first dinner in the US. Later this place became our favorite restaurant:

How beautiful it was! I felt I was back in my hometown…

And sometimes we also went here:

## Cooking

Sometimes we also cook some Chinese food by ourselves. This was in my friend Yiming’s apartment:

## Other choices

There is a McDonald near my apartment:

The hamburgers are much cheaper than in China. For example, a MacChicken costs $1.09 with tax.

There is also Mexican restaurant. Its wrapper is nice:

There are many shops around the apartment. This was shot in [Fred Mayer](http://www.fredmeyer.com/):

$3.99 for 24 bottles of water.

And we can also buy Chinese food for the shop:

This was in my apartment (introduced in [part 3](/posts/the-memory-of-programming-in-seattle-3-living)), you can also see my N73 there:
