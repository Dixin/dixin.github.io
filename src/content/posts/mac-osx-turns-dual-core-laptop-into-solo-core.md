This is blogged because it is surprising. Some months ago my friend and me were investigating Mac OSX for my [WebOS](http://www.coolwebos.com), so we installed the latest version on a machine, [SAMSUNG R25 XE04](http://www.samsung.com/he/products/notebookcomputer/r_series/np_r25.asp) with a [T2330](http://processorfinder.intel.com/details.aspx?sSpec=SLA4K) Dual Core CPU. After that, Windows 7 was installed back. However, Windows recognized his laptop as a Solo Core CPU.

Obviously the resolution is to refresh / update the BIOS. We searched the Internet for this, and found a number of people having this problem. It is hard to understand why could this happen.
