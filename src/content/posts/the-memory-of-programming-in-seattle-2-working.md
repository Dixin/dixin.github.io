In this part, the working environment and style will be introduced. Because I do not prefer to show up my face or the Microsoft office internals here, in this part:

-   Most of the photos outside office are shot by me;
-   All of the photos inside office are from the Internet.

## Microsoft Redmond Campus

The north of Bellevue (introduced in [part 1](/posts/the-memory-of-programming-in-seattle-1-places)) is Redmond. Microsoft Campus is tens of buildings distributed in the trees and flowers. These photos are shot by my [legacy Nokia N73](http://www.nokiausa.com/find-products/phones/nokia-n73).

Actually Redmond is as beautiful as Bellevue. Rabbits and squirrels can be seen frequently:

My friend [Wei](http://wayneye.cn/) tried to give him a cigarette, and I tried to give him a chocolate, but he said he does not like those stuff…

And this was shot during the heavy snow in the winter of 2008:

This is the mail box outside RedWest E. The car is a Microsoft shuttle, which will be introduced later.

Originally I was working in Building 9 at the [main entrance of the campus](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/gallery/imageviewer.mspx?webURL=%2fpresspass%2fimages%2fgallery%2fcampus%2fbldg10_flags_web.jpg&printURL=%2fpresspass%2fimages%2fgallery%2fcampus%2fbldg10_flags_print.jpg&caption=Main+entrance+to+the+Microsoft+Redmond+Campus.&JPGSize=&TiffSize=), later the team was relocated to Building 34:

![20081218260_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/20081218260_thumb_786C41F4.jpg "20081218260_thumb")

**So the exciting thing is, I was working with** [**Bill Gates**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates) **and** [**Steve Ballmer**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer) **in the same building**:)… I was in the 1st floor, and they were in the 5th floor.

I shot this in the garage of Building 40 / 41:

![20080804174_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/20080804174_thumb_3E6CD93B.jpg "20080804174_thumb")

Building 40 and 41 are the office of the .NET and Visual Studio division. We have many thunderous people there, like [Anders Hejlsberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg), etc.

This is the photo of [Microsoft Visitor Center](http://www.microsoft.com/about/companyinformation/visitorcenter/default.aspx), [from Microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/gallery/imageviewer.mspx?webURL=%2Fpresspass%2Fimages%2Ffeatures%2F2005%2F03-21visitor-center_lg.jpg&printURL=&caption=The+Microsoft+Visitor+Center.&JPGSize=&TiffSize=):

![microsoft-visitor-center_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/microsoftvisitorcenter_thumb_7960DF79.jpg "microsoft-visitor-center_thumb")

In 2008 the Visitor Center was relocated to Building 92, as well as [Microsoft Company Store](https://shop.ecompanystore.com/MSEPPStore/login.aspx). I bought several shirts there, like [this one](http://www.cnblogs.com/dixin/archive/2009/10/03/my-microsoft-kid.html).

## Cafeterias

Many buildings have cafeterias. They are excellent, and not expensive at all. We have Chinese food in the cafeteria of Building 88, served by a very nice uncle from Shanghai.

This is the cafeteria of Building 34, where I often had my lunch (The picture is [from Microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/images/gallery/campus/building_34_cafeteria_print.jpg).):

![building-34-cafeteria_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/building34cafeteria_thumb_16E294AC.jpg "building-34-cafeteria_thumb")

And this is the inside view (This picture is [from PCOnline.com.cn](http://www.pconline.com.cn/pcjob/rs/zc/0508/pic/microsoft31.jpg).):

![building-34-cafeteria-inside_thumb_1](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/building34cafeteriainside_thumb_1_77136F49.jpg "building-34-cafeteria-inside_thumb_1")

Below is the way outside Building 16 (This picture is [from PCOnline.com.cn](http://www.pconline.com.cn/pcjob/rs/zc/0508/pic/microsoft19.jpg).). Since the cafeteria of Building 34 does not provide supper, sometimes when I was too lazy to cook, I walked through this way to go to the cafeteria of Building 16 to have supper:

![building-16_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/building16_thumb_373962F7.jpg "building-16_thumb")

On the plates those are the names for each Microsoft product.

This is the salad in the Building 16 cafeteria, each costs $6.95 max, which is cheap enough. I do not use any salad sauce, because it tasted horrible for me:

![S7301896_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/S7301896_thumb_531A7222.jpg "S7301896_thumb")

The drink is a bottle of 100% apple juice. The drink is free. I will talk more about drink later.

## Office

Because publishing pictures of Microsoft office internals might cause trouble, in this section I will mainly use pictures [from the Internet](http://www.pconline.com.cn/pcjob/rs/zc/0508/680779.html).

![microsoft22_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/microsoft22_thumb_7144DD7E.jpg "microsoft22_thumb")

![microsoft26_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/microsoft26_thumb_57CCB477.jpg "microsoft26_thumb")

![microsoft28_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/microsoft28_thumb_6647B09C.jpg "microsoft28_thumb")

The name of the employee is on the plate of his office. I also have my own office in Building 34, but I am sorry I do not prefer to publish photos of my office.

Ok, here is the key point, the drink. There is at least one kitchen for each floor of each building:

![microsoft34_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/microsoft34_thumb_7ABCDA4D.jpg "microsoft34_thumb")

The free drinks includes kinds of cola, kinds of milk, kinds of 100% fruit juice, etc.

And we have free Starbucks coffee and hot chocolate:

![S7301880_thumb_2](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/S7301880_thumb_2_1AC7C13E.jpg "S7301880_thumb_2")

And also other free drinks, like kinds of tea, etc:

![S7301882_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/S7301882_thumb_70F4207D.jpg "S7301882_thumb")

Yes, it is said that “Your drink, our passion!”. My favorite are

-   sprite,
-   chocolate milk,
-   100% apple juice,
-   100% orange juice,
-   hot chocolate.

At the beginning, the most horrible drink for me is [V8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_\(beverage\)). But later we invented a simple way to change it into delicious: heat via the microwave and add a little sugar.

We also have a lot of recreation stuff:

![microsoft33_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/microsoft33_thumb_7CE5EAE4.jpg "microsoft33_thumb")

And this is [from my friend’s blog](http://fastdev.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!8A0406089AAD8752!886.entry):

![street-fight_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/streetfight_thumb_67A7BF6F.jpg "street-fight_thumb")

Yes, [Mark](http://fastdev.spaces.live.com/), Steven and me we are playing [Street fighter II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II) in Building 50. You can see this arcade belongs to the IE team.

This is fancy:

![20081224304_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/20081224304_thumb_0509EAAF.jpg "20081224304_thumb")

You can play with the [surface multi-touch device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface) in the [Microsoft Visitor Center](http://www.microsoft.com/about/companyinformation/visitorcenter/default.aspx), also in Building 43, etc.

## Transportation

Since the buildings are distributed in the campus, people like me (do not have a car to drive) could have trouble. But don’t worry, Microsoft provides [free shuttle service](http://www.microsoft.com/environment/our_commitment/articles/alternative_commuting.aspx) between buildings and areas. For example, sometimes we call a shuttle to go to Building 88 to have the Chinese food, then call a shuttle back to office.

![microsft-shuttle_thumb](https://aspblogs.z22.web.core.windows.net/dixin/Media/microsftshuttle_thumb_5295F162.jpg "microsft-shuttle_thumb")

The above picture [is from Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kylezoa/3656568250/sizes/l/).

This picture looks like the shuttle connector in [Overlake Transit Center](http://www.soundtransit.org/Projects-and-Plans/Project-List/Overlake-Transit-Center.xml), also [from Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thewhir/2422064673/sizes/l/):

Every morning I took a 245 from apartment (in Bellevue, introduced in [part 1](/posts/the-memory-of-programming-in-seattle-1-places)) to office (in Redmond). This one is shot by my Nokia N73:
